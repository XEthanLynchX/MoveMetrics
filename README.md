# MoveMetrics
This project represents my debut as a solo developer, an endeavor born from my unwavering passion for fitness. The application I've crafted revolves around the world of fitness, enabling users to meticulously curate their workout routines. 

Within each routine, users have the power to craft individual 'Exercises' that serve as markers of their progress across sessions. The true essence of personal growth and achievement is captured as users consistently track their exercise performance.

Exclusivity is key: every routine and exercise you create is a unique reflection of your fitness journey. This application ensures privacy and security, with each user's data walled off from others. In addition, the application seamlessly integrates Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for both routines and exercises.

My debut as a solo developer has resulted in an application that's not just about fitness; it's about empowerment, progress, and the pursuit of a healthier self.
