1. My project will be called the TrainExchange. It will aim to solve the issue of sharing a training plan or workout with friends, peers, and others. 
2. I'll be creating this project using the MERN stack. 
3. Features will include a login and logout, users able to post their workouts or training plan, Users will be able to like and (maybe comment) on the plan,
 as well as edit and delete their plan.
